This is a file that will document reasons for a version bump. this is as of
SVN R 6

* Added a version bump to recognize bugs found in the image loading code.  The
code does not properly report errors if the image can't be loaded.  As a
result the code will segfault if the images are not properly loaded.  working
on the fix.

* Added a version bump to signal the "BASE" release from the tux velocity
code.
